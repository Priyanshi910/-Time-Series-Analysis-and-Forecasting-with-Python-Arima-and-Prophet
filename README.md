# -Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting-with-Python-Arima-and-Prophet
Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. 
Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.
Visualized data using time-series decomposition that decomposed our time series into three distinct components: trend, seasonality, and noise.
Applied Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average to find the optimal value to fit the model.
Validated the forecasts and also found the RMSE.
Visualized the forecasts.
Used Facebook Prophet to fit the model and display patterns on different time scales such as yearly, weekly and daily.  
Compared the forecasts for three years for these two categories into the future.
